#### There is only one rmd file, and everything is included in it.
#### Five models were used to analyze the dataset: linear regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, tree models, and Neural Nets.
#### We also apply 3-fold cross validation, variable selection approaches (backward, forward, and subset selection, and ensemble methods (bagging, random forest, and boosting, XGboost) to help us verify and tuning models.
